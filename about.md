Hi,
I'm John.

I'm a computer science student at [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it) in Italy.

I have always been passionate about everything related to computers and technology in general. But, over the years, I discovered a passion for network applications and cybersecurity.

I've participated in various courses and competitions. One of the most important courses I've attended is the [CyberChallenge.IT](https://cyberchallenge.it) (2021) course and the [OliCyber](https://olicyber.it) (2022 & 2023), where I learned the basics of cybersecurity and participated in the national competition.

In 2023, I've joined the [UniUD E-Racing team](https://formulasae.uniud.it/), where I've managed the telemetry server.

Currently, I'm part of the MadrHacks team, a CTF team composed of students from the University of Udine. We participate in various CTF competitions and organize the [SnakeCTF](https://snakectf.org/) competition.

During the 2025 summer, I've been a Software Engineer intern at Uber in Amsterdam. I was in the In Person Payments team, where we manage all the cash and qr payments at Uber.

Also, I have learned various programming languages over the years, like C++, Python and Go. But my favourite is Python, and I closely follow the development of the language.
