Now running on Cloudflare pages.

## Why?

I decided to move from my golang website to a Jekyll website because I had numerous problems with my old solution. For example, sometimes the database would not work so the entire website would go offline.
So now that I have some more time, I moved everything to Jekyll.

## New hosting

Now for hosting I use Cloudflare Pages, so the entire website is now on the Cloudflare network.
I have also considered GitHub Pages, but I did not like the high latency of the website.

## Now Open Source

I decided to make this website open source, so you can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jotonedev/blog). Also, you can checkout the theme I made for this website [here](https://github.com/jotonedev/tallneck).
