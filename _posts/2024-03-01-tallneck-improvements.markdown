I've rewritten the entire theme with the objective of making it more readable and faster. I've also improved the design to make it more appealing.

## Improvements

Now, instead of vanilla css, it uses scss. This allows me to organize the code better and make it more maintainable. Also, in the production the css is automatically minified.

Also, the code blocks are now customized and have syntax highlighting, with different colors for white mode and dark mode.

The font was changed from Roboto to Open Sans, which is, in my opinion, more readable. Also, I've noticed that I was using the same font for bold and italic, so now the website serve the correct font for each style.

## PWA support

The website now has PWA support, so you can install it on your phone or computer and use it as an app.

## Lighthouse score

The lighthouse score has improved a lot. Now it has 100 in performance, 100 in accessibility, 100 in best practices, 100 in SEO and PWA support.
